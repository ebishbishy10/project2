# project2
this is my second project for udacity nano degree program
it contains httml file (index.html)and astyle file (style.css)
also the other style sheet is resposable for making the design responsive and a img file

this project made me realize how is working with standards is tough.
I realized how that to become developer you have to consider people hope are reading your code and make your code clear.
**********
to run this project :
1 make sure that you have css folder and img folder in the same directory with the html file.
run the index.html and the page should show up on your defult browser.
